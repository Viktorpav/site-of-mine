# site-of-mine
Static Site S3 of Mine, fully managed by CloudFormation!

The idea to create a skillet of fully automated flow of creating static website, with which people can use it for their needs and build it without manual intervantion.

### Docs how to use:

##### Create the website via launching script.sh localy on your laptop

1. [Install AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html) :shipit:
2. [Configuration of AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-quickstart.html) *insert your own AWS account values as described in the link.*
3. Create Hosted zone record in Route53
``` 
aws route53 create-hosted-zone --name <your domain name> \
--caller-reference <any unique string>\
--hosted-zone-config Comment='using aws cli',PrivateZone=false
```
4. [Add hosted zone records of NS to DNS provider(move to AWS records) or choose and create in AWS](https://www.virtuallyboring.com/migrate-godaddy-domain-and-dns-to-aws-route-53/)

5. Get project from GitHub:
```
git clone https://github.com/Viktorpav/site-of-mine.git
cd site-of-mine
```
6. Execute script.sh to initiate the project and infrastructure <br />
#-In case of --profile need, add to each command <br />
#--In case of first run with 2 paramiter <br />
#---Run - ./script.sh <domain name> <any uniq value>

- [x] [Create user for boto3 via terraform](https://github.com/Viktorpav/iooding/commit/b05e3b96ba98f6d4403d18835934efbad1e8e520)
- [x] terraform apply -exclude=module.aws_ec2_public_instance
    - Run terraform apply after extract output and one more time terraform apply

- [x] Setup S3 bucket
- [x] Should be written in CloudFormation all setupSetup Route53
- [x] Handle CloudFront
- [x] Fully managed site creation from scratch(domain required)Site blogs which I like: https://www.rosswickman.com/experienceGitHub actions:  - to sync S3 bucket 
- [x] To deploy CloudFormation stack 1.ACM and 2.Main stack 


- [x]GitHub actions:
    - to sync S3 bucket 
    - to clean up S3 bucket
    - monitoring cost deploy
    - To deploy CloudFormation stack 1.ACM and 2.Main stack 

- [x] Automate of fetching info:
    - HostedZoneId - in acm-certificate cli

    - Certificate Founding - in static-site cli
	
	- --distribution-id=E2046M05Q79E1L - in s3 sync cli



- [x] Configure Price Class of CloudFront 

- [x] Create dns record in Route53

- [x] AWS Amplify Console for S3 static siteDocumentation - used for simple start and go solutions

Go through ChatGTP recommendation:

Setup CloudFront Origin Access Control (OAC) - don’t work for website case
The static website server provided by the S3 service for a bucket is http only, no support for https. Your custom origin config says https-only, so it won't be able to contact the origin.
The best way to do this is disable the bucket's website and public access and instead of using a custom origin, use an S3 origin secured by an Origin Access Identity. That's a special CloudFront principal that you grant permissions to in your bucket policy.
Then for best practice enable all the Block Public Access settings on the bucket. Bonus points for doing that at the account level too and never making any of your buckets public!


- [x] Divide on 2 yaml, one with S3 website endpoint / S3 bucket endpoint(more secure)

———————————————
"""Add WAF, Shield and AWS FIrewall Manager to CloudFront | AWS WAF web ACL - optional
Choose the web ACL in AWS WAF to associate with this distribution."""

- [x] No need above due to the using S3 Origin type


- [x] CloudFront shielding Origin in case no clearmonitor the app behind CF and see the advantage/disavantage, don't use it.

———————————————
- [x] Check in AWS Console every resource all functions:CloudFront(2 Origins access ?,) - should be 2
- [x] Check S3 bucket section Default encryption - no need 

- [x] Check error handling 403 - improved

- [x] Check tool cfn-lint and AWS CloudFormation Linter - implied

——————————————
- [x] MAKE MONiTORiNG OF BiLLiNG - done general cost monitoring
- [x] MAKE MONiTORiNG of SERViCES (CLOD FRONT “redirect function and check all features etc) - implemented monitoring for client interaction

———————————————
- [x] Add video (video striming)
    - Take care of CloudFront for media
    - In General make a resourch how to better store and stream video to users

——
- [x] Improve Access Dined on the bucket to redirect to 404, 403 page
- [x] Respond with 503 page when some maintaining
Improve GitHub action to pull somehow video too(from local) - now I need to push it manually locally 
Improve Video Transcoder  for videos in S3 bucket

———————————————
- [x] Add video (video streaming)
    - Take care of CloudFront for media
    - In General make a research how to better store and stream video to users

————————
If someone connect from Russia redirect them to Ukrainian Crypto Wallet organization(cloudfront function + aws doc) - but redirect could cause google rate(better to not allow)

———————————————
- [x] Work on Github Action Warning


———————————————
Improve caching of CloudFront distribution
Add CloudFront logs bucket and function - under consideration	if it is useful 

Improvement:
- Use CloudFront Logs: Use the logging feature in CloudFront to monitor and analyze the performance of your delivered assets. You can use data analytics tools, like Amazon Athena or Amazon Redshift, to analyze logs and make smart business decisions.

- Use Compression: Use compression in CloudFront Distribution to reduce file size and speed up page loading.
 \\ Test with PageSpeed tool Compress property of the DefaultCacheBehavior object to true
